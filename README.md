## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.x, Flask
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Database Driver**: Flask-MySQLdb

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- MySQL Server 5.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd "Mini Project"
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:
```bash
pip install flask flask-mysqldb google-generativeai
```

### 2.1. Setup Google Gemini AI (Optional but Recommended)

The AI tag suggestion feature uses Google Gemini. To enable it:

1. Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Set the API key as an environment variable:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

**Or create a `.env` file** (recommended for development):
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

**Note:** The app will work without the AI feature, but tag suggestions will use a fallback keyword extraction method.

### 3. Database Setup

1. Start your MySQL server
2. Open MySQL command line or MySQL Workbench
3. Run the database schema file (create the SQL file from your schema or run the DDL statements)

The database schema includes:
- `app_user` - User accounts
- `notebook` - User notebooks
- `category` - Note categories
- `category_hierarchy` - Category relationships
- `note` - Main notes table
- `note_history` - Version history
- `tag` - Available tags

- `attachment` - File attachments
- `collaboration` - Shared notes
- `comment` - Note comments
- `reminder` - User reminders
- `tag_suggestion` - AI tag suggestions
- `bookmark` - User bookmarks

### 4. Configure Database Connection

Edit `app.py` and update the MySQL configuration:

```python
app.config['MYSQL_HOST'] = 'localhost'
app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'root'  # Your MySQL username
app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = 'admin'  # Your MySQL password
app.config['MYSQL_DB'] = 'pkb1'  # Your database name
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## 🤖 AI Features

### Google Gemini Integration

The application uses Google Gemini AI to provide intelligent tag suggestions:

1. **Automatic Tag Generation**: Analyzes note title and content to suggest relevant tags
2. **Context-Aware**: Considers existing tags in the system for better suggestions
3. **Confidence Scores**: Each suggestion includes a confidence score (0.0-1.0)
4. **Smart Fallback**: Uses keyword extraction when AI is unavailable

### How to Use AI Tag Suggestions

1. Open any note by clicking on it
2. Scroll to the "🏷️ AI Tag Suggestions" section
3. Click the "🤖 Auto-Suggest with AI" button
4. Wait for AI to analyze the content (usually 2-5 seconds)
5. Review the suggested tags with confidence scores
6. Tags are automatically added to the suggestions list

### AI Setup

Make sure to set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable for AI features to work. Without it, the app will use a fallback keyword extraction method.
